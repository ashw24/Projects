Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION
In this lab, we are given various tasks to complete in which there are 4 input switches and the outputs have to follow a specific set of rules. For Part A, the 4 inputs serve as each bit in a 7-segment display, in which in_0 is the first bit, in_1 is the second bit, so on and so forth. For Part B, a logic cicuit is constructed from the truth tables provided on the documentation. For Part C, 3 logic circuits must be constructed in which they must use any type of gate for the first part, only NAND gates for the thrid part, and only NOR for the last. The outputs must correspond with the truth tables provided.
