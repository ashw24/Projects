Here is a short summary: \n","\n","### Submitting your work\n","\n","To submit your work: \n","\n","* First, click on \"Runtime > Restart and run all\", and check that you get no errors.  This enables you to catch any error you might have introduced, and not noticed, due to your running cells out of order. \n","* Second, download the notebook in .ipynb format (File > Download .ipynb) and upload the .ipynb file to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeK1VhGtlPNj6D7UoCgl1VhGJHsk7Rx7UxUrEpAcDnR7PRDuA/viewform?usp=sf_link). \n","\n","You can submit multiple times; the last submission before the deadline is the one that counts.\n","\n","### Homework format\n","\n","For each question in this notebook, there is: \n","\n","* A text description of the problem. \n","* One or more places where you have to insert your solution.  You need to complete every place marked: \n","\n","    `# YOUR CODE HERE`\n","    \n","    and you should not modify any other place. \n","* One or more test cells.  Each cell is worth some number of points, marked at the top.  You should not modify these tests cells.  The tests pass if no error is printed out: when there is a statement that says, for instance: \n","\n","    `assert x == 2`\n","    \n","    then the test passes if `x` has value 2, and fails otherwise.  You can insert a `print(x)` (for this case!) somewhere if you want to debug your work; it is up to you.  \n","    \n","### Notes:\n","\n","* Your code will be tested both according to the tests you can see (the `assert` statements you can see), _and_ additional tests.  This prevents you from hard-coding the answer to the particular questions posed.  Your code should solve the _general_ intended case, not hard-code the particular answer for the values used in the tests. \n","\n","* **Please do not delete or add cells!** The test is autograded, and if you modify the test by adding or deleting cells, even if you re-add cells you delete, you may not receive credit. \n","\n","* **Please do not import modules that are not part of the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).** You do not need any, and they will likely not available in the grading environment, leading your code to fail. \n","\n","* **If you are inactive too long, your notebook might get disconnected from the back-end.** Your work is never lost, but you have to re-run all the cells before you continue. \n","\n","* You can write out print statements in your code, to help you test/debug it. But remember: the code is graded on the basis of what it outputs or returns, not on the basis of what it prints.\n","\n","* **TAs and tutors have access to this notebook,** so if you let them know you need their help, they can look at your work and give you advice. \n","\n","### Grading\n","\n","Each cell where there are tests is worth a certain number of points.  You get the points allocated to a cell only if you pass _all_ the tests in the cell. \n","\n","The tests in a cell include both the tests you can see, and other, similar, tests that are used for grading only.  Therefore, you cannot hard-code the solutions: you really have to solve the essence of the problem, to receive the points in a cell. \n","\n","### Code of Conduct\n","\n","* Work on the test yourself, alone. \n","* You can search documentation on the web, on sites such as the Python documentation sites, Stackoverflow, and similar, and you can use the results. \n","* You cannot share your work with others or solicit their help.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"35ciHM6LWRJz"},"source":["## Submission\n","\n","[Please submit to this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0r9gB2y6Wcf4pWM9aqpzyZfQOvNqFJol36NtS4Msdvd3VXA/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n","\n","Deadline: Tuesday December 8, 11pm (check on Canvas for updated information)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0xKfNENLWRJ0"},"source":["## Test Format\n","\n","There are 6 questions, but not all of them require you to write code: \n","* Question 1 asks you to complete the code for propagating a single cell.\n","* Question 2 asks you to write the code to propagate all cells. \n","* For Question 3, you just need to copy your solution to Question 2 in another place. \n","* Question 4 asks you to implement a helper function that detects elements that occur in only one of a list of sets. \n","* Question 5 asks you to implement the _where can it go_ heuristic. \n","* Question 6 simply checks that your code is efficient; you don't need to write any code. \n","\n","There are a total of 70 points.

In these problems, the solution is attained through a mix of search (we attempt to fill a square with a number and see if it works out), and constraint propagation (if we fill a square with, say, a 1, then there can be no 1's in the same row, column, and 3x3 square).\n","\n","Second, and related, the way we go about solving Sudoku puzzles is closely related to how [SAT solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Algorithms_for_solving_SAT) work.

This would work in some sense, but it would not be a very useful representation.  If you have solved Sudoku by hand (and if you have not, please go and solve a couple; it will teach you a lot about what we need to do), you will know that the following strategy works: \n","\n","Repeat: \n","* Look at all blank spaces.  Can you find one where only one digit fits? If so, write the digit there. \n","* If you cannot find any blank space as above, try to find one where only a couple or so digits can fit.  Try putting in one of those digits, and see if you can solve the puzzle with that choice.  If not, backtrack, and try another digit. \n","\n","Thus, it will be very useful to us to remember not only the known digits, but also, which digits can fit into any blank space. \n","Hence, we represent a Sudoku problem via a $9 \\times 9$ matrix of _sets_: each set contains the digits that can fit in a given space. \n","Of course, a known digit is just a set containing only one element. \n","We will solve a Sudoku problem by progressively \"shrinking\" these sets of possibilities, until they all contain exactly one element. \n","\n","Let us write some code that enables us to define a Sudoku problem, and display it for us; this will be very useful both for our fun and for debugging. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uiOwuKRWWRJ2"},"source":["First, though, let's write a tiny helper function that returns the only element from a singleton set."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_Zomx6jsWRJ2"},"source":["def getel(s):\n","    \"\"\"Returns the unique element in a singleton set (or list).\"\"\"\n","    assert len(s) == 1\n","    return list(s)[0]\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yTx2V8IFWRJ3"},"source":["import json\n","\n","class Sudoku(object):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, elements):\n","        \"\"\"Elements can be one of:\n","        Case 1: a list of 9 strings of length 9 each.\n","        Each string represents a row of the initial Sudoku puzzle,\n","        with either a digit 1..9 in it, or with a blank or _ to signify\n","        a blank cell.\n","        Case 2: an instance of Sudoku.

The strategy can be summarized thus: **choice - constraint propagation - recursion.** \n","\n","In the _choice_ step, we make one guess from a set of possible guesses.  If we want our search for a solution to be exhaustive, as in the above Sudoku example, we ensure that we try iteratively all choices from a set of choices chosen so that at least one of them must succeed.  In the above example, we know that at least one of the digit values must be the true one, hence our search is exhaustive.  In other cases, we can trade off exhaustiveness for efficiency, and we may try only a few choices, guided perhaps by an heuristic. \n","\n","The _constraint propagation_ step propagates the consequences of the choice to the problem.  Each choice thus gives rise to a new problem, which is a little bit simpler than the original one as some of the possible choices, that is, some of its complexity, has been removed.  In the Sudoku case, the new problem has less indetermination, as at least one more of its cells has a known digit in it. \n","\n","The problems resulting from _constraint propagation_, while simpler, may not be solved yet.  Hence, we _recur_, calling the solution procedure on them as well.  As these problems are simpler (they contain fewer choices), eventually the recursion must reach a point where no more choice is possible, and whether constraint propagation should yield a completely defined problem, one of which it is possible to say whether it is solvable or not with a trivial test.  This forms the base case for the recursion. \n","\n","This solution strategy applies very generally, to problems well beyond Sudoku."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lSQtZWGiWRJ_"},"source":["## Part 2: Digits must go somewhere\n","\n","If you have played Sudoku before, you might have found the way we solved Sudoku puzzles a bit odd. \n","The constraint we encoded is: \n","\n","> If a digit appears in a cell, it cannot appear anywhere else on the same row, column, or 3x3 block as the cell. \n","\n","This _is_ a rule of Sudoku.

The first is: are the two definitions equivalent? \n","Well, no; the first definition does not say what the digits are (e.g., does not rule out 0).  But in our Sudoku representation, we _start_ by saying that every cell can contain only one of 1...9.  If every row (or column, or 3x3 block) cannot contain more than one repetition of each digit, and if there are 9 digits and 9 cells in the row (or column, or block), then clearly every digit must appear exactly once in the row (or column, or block).  So once the set of digits is specified, the two definitions are equivalent. \n","\n","The second question is: but still, what happens to the method we usually employ to solve Sudoku? \n","I generally don't solve Sudoku puzzles by focusing on one cell at a time, and thinking: is it the case that this call can contain only one digit? \n","This is the strategy employed by the solver above.  But it is not the strategy I normally use. \n","I generally solve Sudoku puzzles by looking at a block (or row, or column), and thinking: let's consider the digit $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 9$).  Where can it go in the block?  And if I find that the digit can go in one block cell only, I write it there.  \n","Does the solver work even without this \"where can it go\" strategy?  And can we make it follow it? \n","\n","The solver works even without the \"where can it go\" strategy because it exaustively tries all possibilities.  This means the solver works without the strategy; it does not say that the solver works _well_ without the strategy. \n","\n","We can certainly implement the _where can it go_ strategy, as part of constraint propagation; it would make our solver more efficient. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GTOzOkAUWRJ_"},"source":["## Question 3: A better `full_propagation` method\n","### Not a real question; just copy some previous code into a new method.\n","There is a subtle point in applying the _where can it go_ heuristics. \n","\n","Before, when our only constraint was the uniqueness in each row, column, and block, we needed to propagate only from cells that hold a singleton value. \n","If a cell held a non-singleton set of digits, such as $\\{2, 5\\}$, no values could be ruled out as a consequence of this on the same row, column, or block. \n","\n","The _where can it go_ heuristic, instead, benefits from knowing that in a cell, the set of values went for instance from $\\{2, 3, 5\\}$ to $\\{2, 5\\}$: by ruling out the possibility of a $3$ in this cell, it may be possibe to deduct that the digit $3$ can appear in only one (other) place in the block, and place it there. \n","\n","Thus, we modify the `full_propagation` method.
